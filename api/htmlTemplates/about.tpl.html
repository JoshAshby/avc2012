      <h1>About the AVC</h1>
<p>SparkFun’s Autonomous Vehicle Competition (AVC) is an event that invites teams from all over the world to descend on SparkFun HQ in Boulder, Colo., for a no-holds-barred autonomous vehicle race around our building.</p>

<p>The requirements are few: Teams must provide a home-built vehicle that will circumnavigate SparkFun’s building without any human intervention. This year’s competition will host a record-breaking 50 teams, with entrants competing for a grand prize of $1,000. SparkFun also will offer smaller prizes in categories such as Engineer’s Choice, for the best-designed vehicle, and the Kill Switch Award, for the most dangerous. There are both aerial and ground categories, and it makes for a great day of robotics competition and good old-fashioned SparkFun camaraderie.</p>
<br>

<h2>GROUND VEHICLE RULES</h2>
<br>

<ul>
<li>Vehicles are only required to go around all four exterior walls of the building. No “exact” course will be marked, but sections will be roped off to keep spectators off of the main “expected” course.</li>

<li>No environmental modifications allowed (competitors may not put down tape, IR beacons, or any other temporary or semi-permanent marks).</li>

<li>There will be four large barrels placed as obstacles on the course, spaced no closer than 15 feet to each other, positions to be determined on race day.</li>

<li>Raw times for each run will be calculated from when a ground vehicle first crosses the start/finish line, goes around the building, and again crosses the start/finish line. If a vehicle becomes stuck for more than 60 seconds, it is disqualified for that run (that’s usually enough time to determine that there’s a problem).</li>

<li>There will be an arch (imagine croquet) located somewhere on the course, actual position to be determined on race day. Any ground vehicle that goes through the hoop gets 30 seconds off their official time for that run. The arch will be painted red for ease of optical identification, and a picture of this arch will be made available before race day for all competitors to see. The arch will be 53" wide at the widest and 34" tall in the middle.</li>

<li>Max time limit per run is five minutes.</li>

<li>Kill switches are required for vehicles over 30 pounds, to be demonstrated to the judges on race day.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>AIR VEHICLE RULES</h2>
<br>

<li>No quadcopters or helicopters allowed!</li>

<li>Air vehicles must also go around all four exterior walls of the building.</li>

<li>The lap time will be calculated from when the Judge says 'Go' to when the plane comes to a halt in the back parking lot. A landing (autonomous or manned) outside the rear parking lot will disqualify the lap time.</li>

<li>Weather permitting, balloons on long freaking strings will be launched from the four corners of the building. The balloons will serve as guides for the judges/competitors as to the location of the corners/walls, which the non-ground vehicles must circumnavigate.</li>

<li>Regardless of weather/wind, the vehicles must clear the four exterior walls/corners of the building (not the balloons); verification of clearing the vertical plane will be up to the four line judges.</li>

<li>Autonomous take-off is worth a 10-second reduction from raw time.</li>

<li>Wheel carriages are allowed for aircraft that don't have their own wheels. Human assisted take-off (throwing a plane) is not considered autonomous.</li>

<li>Autonomous landing (coming to a halt) within the indicated box is worth a 30-second reduction in time.</li>

<li>Landing within SFE’s back lot parking area (not in the box, but must be on our blacktop) gets a 10-second reduction in raw time.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
<br>

<ul>
<li>SparkFun’s first AVC took place in 2009 and drew around 100 spectators -- last year’s AVC drew almost 700 spectators</li>
<li>In the first AVC, only two teams successfully completed the course</li>
<li>The first AVC drew eight teams, the second had 18, and the third drew over 40 – this year we are hosting 50 teams</li>
<li>In 2010, separate categories were created for aerial and ground vehicles</li>
<li>One team has recorded a negative time by virtue of time deductions for autonomous take-offs and landings – Team Robota in 2010 with an official time of -4 seconds</li>
<li>The longest time for a successful course completion was Team Autocrusher in 2010 with a time of 3 minutes and 27 seconds</li>
<li>The fastest time by a ground vehicle was by Team DeathPod3000 in 2009 with an official time of 1 minute and 32 seconds</li>
<li>SparkFun CEO Nathan Seidle created an autonomous vehicle for the 2009 AVC that was driven by an Elmo doll</li>
<li>Number of times the fire department has been called to the AVC: Once, in 2009, when a UAV got stuck in a tree</li>
<li>Last year, three vehicles ended up in the lake. One of them went in twice</li>
